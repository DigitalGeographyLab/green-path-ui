# Green paths UI

A user interface for [the green path route optimization application](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/hope-green-path-server/) being developed for [UIA HOPE project](https://ilmanlaatu.eu/briefly-in-english/) â€“ Healthy Outdoor Premises for Everyone.

Its goal is to inform people on clean routes for walking and cycling in Helsinki region. It utilizes Air Quality Index (AQI) from the Enfuser model (by the Finnish Meteorological Institute) and modelled traffic noise data. AQI is based on hourly updated and combined information on NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and O3.

Currently implemented features include calculation of walkable quiet paths with respect to typical daily traffic noise levels. The exposure-based routing application and user interface are based on [an MSc thesis](https://github.com/hellej/quiet-paths-msc).
